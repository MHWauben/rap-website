title: Tax your vehicle
---

Tax your car, motorcycle or other vehicle using a reference number from:

* a recent reminder (V11) or ‘last chance’ warning letter from DVLA
* your vehicle log book (V5C) - it must be in your name
* the green ‘new keeper’s details’ slip (V5C/2) from a log book if you’ve just
  bought it

You can pay by debit or credit card, or Direct Debit.

You must tax your vehicle even if you do not have to pay anything, for example
if [you’re exempt](https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-exempt-from-vehicle-tax) because
you’re disabled.

You’ll need to meet all the [legal
obligations](https://www.gov.uk/legal-obligations-drivers-riders) for drivers
before you can drive.

> This service is also available [in Welsh](https://www.gov.uk/treth-car).
