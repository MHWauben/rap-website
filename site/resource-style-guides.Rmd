# Style guides and best practices

It is easier to write and review code that conforms to a familiar style.

There is no one true style guide for every domain because some things are only
relevant in certain places.  For example, it might be helpful to refer to
prescription medications in a consistent way, but only if you write a lot of
code about medicine.

Here are some style guides used in the UK Civil Service.

* [Ministry of Justice Analytical Services Coding Standards](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/our-coding-standards)
* [Data Science Campus Coding Standards](https://datasciencecampus.github.io/coding-standards/)
* [Public Health and Intelligence R Style Guide](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/R-Resources/blob/master/PHI%20R%20style%20guide.md)

Best practices are more about what code you write than how you write it.  For
example, there are many ways to access databases, but one particular way might
be considered 'best practice' so that everyone in a team knows how it works and
doesn't have to learn other methods.

ISD Scotland has several [methodology
papers](https://www.isdscotland.org/About-ISD/Methodologies/) about using
process checklists, statistical methods, data sources and technologies.
